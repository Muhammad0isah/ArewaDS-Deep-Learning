#Q1. Turn the code to get the data (from section 1. Get Data) into a Python script, such as `get_data.py`.* When you run the script using `python get_data.py` it should check if the data already exists and skip downloading if it does.* If the data download is successful, you should be able to access the `pizza_steak_sushi` images from the `data` directory.
